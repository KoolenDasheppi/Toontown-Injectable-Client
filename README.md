Toontown Infinite
=================

This is my edited fork of Toontown infinite to include an old style "Injector" opened when launched. It also has some edited server source to run boss exploits the same as they did in the original Toontown.

This distribution will also execute any sourcecode located in "mods" the same as Cody's old mod loader.

Old Description
===============

Toontown Infinite is a free, non-profit game inspired by _Disney's Toontown Online_.
